# Coffee_Machine
ABOUT:
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, I worked on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

HOW TO RUN:
Run the .py file in your terminal application. Refer to OS for instructions. 
All commands to navigate the program are listed in the menus.

OBJECTIVES:
The main obejectives during my learning process on this application, was working with Functions, Loops and conditions, and building more confidence whilst learning Python.

ABOUT ME:
My name is Dave, I am 35 years old, currently learning to program with my first language, Python, whilst in COVID-19 lockdown in Melbourne, Australia. My intention is to become a software developer in 2021 and beyond. I'm interested in back-end software development, as well as native audio software development (based on interest from my previous work). I plan to learn C++ as my next language.
